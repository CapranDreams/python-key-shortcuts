# python-key-shortcuts
Python keyboard shortcut utility to do short keyboard automation in any program

Instructions:
  Set up keyboard (and/or mouse) sequence under def codenames_capture(). The example pykey.py is set up to run a sequence of operations in Photoshop that copy and selected area, create a new file with it, resize it, save it as a jpg with a particular name, and then close the new file. Anything that can be done with clicking or keyboards in an easily defined way can be done in a similar fashion.
  Change the keys in COMBINATIONS to match what keys you want to press to perform the operation in codenames_capture(). In my example, press "\" + "insert" keys (in either order, but together) to run.
  Once configured, run the python script and move it out of the way. You can return to whatever program you want to interact with and press your keyboard shortcut defined above at any time. Manually close the python script when done.
